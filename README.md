#### 👤 About me

Hi I'm Mohammad reza

I'm a computer & programming enthusiast with around 3-4 years of hands-on experience coding in **C#** and **Python**.  
Recently, I've been diving into **Android development with Flutter** and enjoying the ride.

Most of my work has been around **Telegram bot development**, but I also mess around with:

- AI stuff (still learning, still breaking things)
- API development
- Writing scripts to automate anything that looks repetitive

I enjoy building practical tools, experimenting with new tech, and turning ideas into working code.  
Always learning, always shipping.
